    availability: 'Full availability March 10–30. Conflict: April 2–5 (theater commitment).',
    performanceNotes: 'Strongest in understated moments. Let silence do the work. Tends to over-gesture when nervous — remind him to stay still. Best takes usually come after take 3.',
    preferredTakes: 'Sc.1: Take 4 (the long pause before he exits the car). Sc.5: Take 2 (voice crack on "I knew").',
    costumeNotes: 'Worn leather jacket (hero piece), faded blue jeans, desert boots. No watch — Marcus stopped tracking time.',

    availability: 'Available March 15–28. Must wrap by March 28 — starts next project April 1.',
    performanceNotes: 'Incredible with micro-expressions. Camera loves her in close-up. Give her space to improvise the physical business — she finds great moments. Prefers minimal direction, responds well to emotional context rather than line readings.',
    preferredTakes: 'Sc.5: Take 6 (the phone call — raw, unscripted moment at the end).',
    costumeNotes: 'Hospital scrubs for Sc.5 flashback. Otherwise: structured blazer, dark colors, always put-together. Wedding ring on a chain necklace (hidden under shirt).',

    availability: 'Limited — 2 days only. Must schedule Sc.8 and Sc.18 back to back if possible.',
    performanceNotes: 'Natural comedian — needs to be reined in for dramatic beats. The diner scene (Sc.8) should feel like he\'s performing for Marcus, hiding something. Let him do one loose take, then tighten.',
    costumeNotes: 'Expensive but slightly tacky — designer jeans, flashy watch, too-tight polo. Ray has money but no taste.',
